# VIDchain-demo-v2

This repository contains two demo projects:

 - **vidchain-government** to simulate a government where, once authenticated with VIDChain (or a fake user/pass: santi/any), you can claim a "Large Family" credential
 - **vidchain-university** to simulate a university where, once authenticated with VIDChain, you can claim a student credential and request a discount by presenting a "Large Family" credential.
